Welcome to the Inititative initiative tracking system Ver 1.0!

To import your party when the program starts (and to save members between sessions), open party.csv in a simpletext editor and add your party members in comma seperated values pairs:

Party Member Name,Dexterity Score

Make sure party.csv stays in the same directory as inititative.py! And don't delete the first line!


When you're setting all the initiatives, you can set the init to be "roll X" where X is the number of sides on the dice, the system will then prompt you for that character's initiative modifier. (This is mostly for the DM's sake for rolling monster inititatives.)
